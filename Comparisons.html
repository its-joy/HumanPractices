                    Both projects aim to provide an alternative form of glucose monitoring currently employed. However, Gliksys is designed as a whole-cell biosensor in a bio-ink to be printed or directly applied onto the skin where it will show a colorimetric change in response to higher glucose levels. This designed had its issues. Mainly, the team did not succeed in creating a easily visible color change for the patient to see since it relied on a fluorescent signal proportional to glucose concentration. Additionally, there is no notable mention on the durability of the bio-ink onto the skin. One of the primary objectives of Gluessel is increasing the durability and lifetime of the biosensor on the skin. As opposed to the colorimetric change of Gliksys, Gluessel hopes to use external software to aid in interpreting the signals of the biosensor.

                  <p class="mt-3 mb-4">https://2019.igem.org/Team:BSC_United/Sensor
                    While both Gluessel and MINILOSS include aspects of glucose monitoring, the ultimate goal of MINILOSS is to enable probiotic bacteria within the GI tract to sense glucose levels and secrete insulin. Both projects utilize a electrochemical biosensor with the enzyme glucose oxidase for glucose monitoring. To address the issue of short life for current electrochemical sensors, this team immobilized the enzyme glucose oxidase on the electrode of the sensor using a chitosan entrapment. Gluessel will instead use mussel adhesive proteins to increase the life of our biosensor, which shows considerable promise for greater durability. MINILOSS also appears to need the biosensor to be inside the GI tract or near the liver, which can present issues pertaining to keeping the biosensor active in these harsh internal environments. Gluessel will monitor intravenous glucose levels which are simpler to read and removes the need for reaching inaccessible areas in the body.

                    Both Gluessel and INSULEN have systems in place to monitor glucose levels in the body, and both have plans of using an app to easily provide the patient with glucose level data. However, INSULEN mainly focuses on reducing glucose levels using N-palmitoyl serinol, while Gluessel primarily focuses on improving the process of glucose monitoring itself. There is not much information on the glucose monitoring aspect of the INSULEN project, since it seems they are utilizing a pre-existing blood sugar monitor. This would suggest that the glucose monitor they employ would suffer all the same shortcomings with current glucose monitors that Gluessel hopes to address. They use this data to inform a wearable gene expression control device that responds to the real-time data. However, this device is large and obtrusive. Gluessel will focus on creating a design that is subtle and unobtrusive to the patient.
