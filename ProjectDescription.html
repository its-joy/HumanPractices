            <p class="card-text">
              Microneedles offer a solution for diabetes patients seeking a minimally invasive and more effective alternative to conventional needles used in Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs). While traditional needles may cause minimal pain, microneedle arrays have the potential to revolutionize glucose sensing by improving the lifespan of glucose-sensing enzymes and enhancing the sensitivity of glucose sensors. The high surface area of microneedle arrays provides ample immobilization sites for enzymes, which increases enzyme loading capacity and stability, thereby protecting the immobilized enzyme and enhancing sensitivity to glucose fluctuation in Interstitial Fluid (ISF). Moreover, when combined with a machine learning model and algorithm, microneedle arrays can provide more precise and accurate glucose readings, further enhancing their effectiveness. The combination of microneedle arrays and machine learning has the potential to increase the integrability of CGMs with other diabetes management tools, closing the loop and offering a more comprehensive and effective personal health management solution.

              The combination of MAPs and microneedles presents an exciting avenue for enhancing the stability and lifespan of biosensors. With its high concentration of DOPA residue, MAPs offer a unique opportunity to form an even film on the surface of electrodes through electrochemical oxidation in one step. 
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              The process begins with the preparation of a MAP and GOx mixture in acetate buffer. The mixture is then subjected to electropolymerization on the working electrode of the microneedle sensor, utilizing potential cycling from -0.3-0.7 V against Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 100mVs-1. During this process, the oxidation of MAP molecules and their covalent bonding with GOx enzymes occur simultaneously in one step, resulting in the formation of an even layer on the microneedle's surface. The electrochemical oxidation method for coating microneedles with MAPs and GOx offers numerous benefits, including improved stability, extended lifespan, and enhanced sensitivity of glucose sensors. Our approach is a promising step forward in the development of more robust biosensors that can deliver accurate, reliable glucose readings for diabetes management.

              Gluessel is dedicated to advancing diabetes management by developing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms that can provide more precise and accurate real-time glucose readings for end users. By incorporating our algorithms into our software and app, we aim to offer a more personalized approach to diabetes management that is tailored to the unique needs and preferences of each individual.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              Our machine learning models are designed to learn patterns and trends in the data over time as well as individualsâ€™ metabolic profile, allowing for more accurate predictions and recommendations for diabetes management. By analyzing data from CGMs and other sources, our algorithms can provide personalized insights into how different factors impact glucose levels for each patient, including food intake, exercise, and stress. This information can help patients and healthcare providers make more informed decisions about insulin dosages and other diabetes management strategies.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              In addition to offering more precise and accurate glucose readings, our machine learning algorithms have the potential to be integrated with other diabetes management tools, such as automatic insulin delivery. This integration can further enhance the personalization and effectiveness of diabetes management, ultimately leading to better integrability with technologies and closing the loop within diabetes management. Overall, at Gluessel, we are committed to advancing the field of diabetes management through the development of innovative machine learning algorithms that offer more precise and personalized approaches to diabetes management.
