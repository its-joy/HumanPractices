                    Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is one of the most popular personal health management tools. 
                    However, the current CGM has a limited lifespan and creates lot’s of medical waste. 
                    The limited lifespan of CGM’s has led to high maintenance costs ranging from $3000-$6000 per year. 
                    Gluessel is committed to combine synthetic biology and innovative technologies to close the gap between diabetes patients and personal health management tools.

                <p class="card-text">
                  MAPs, derived from blue sea mussels, are an exceptional class of adhesive agents due to their remarkable strength, flexibility, and biocompatibility. Thanks to their abundant DOPA residue content, they can easily form a stable film on electrodes, making them ideal for the fast and selective immobilization of glucose oxidase on the electrode's surface. This results in longer enzyme activity in the human body, which is essential for glucose detection. However, the current extraction method for MAPs is neither environmentally friendly nor economically feasible, requiring 10,000 mussels to produce just 1g of MAPs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To overcome these challenges, Gluessel proposes a method to produce recombinant MAPs that can be used as biomedical adhesives and coatings on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices or other biomedical applications. This innovative approach involves fusion of MAPs and GvpA as well as production of recombinant plasmid in E.coli and co-expression of protein in P.Pastoris. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Mfp5 and Mfp3 are selected from the MAPs group due to their strong adhesive property. The coding sequence of Mfp5-CsgA and Mfp2-GvpA genes will be inserted into E.Coli for recombinant plasmid propagation. GvpA is an amyloid-like fiber and cross-linking protein derived from Dolichospermum flosaquae, a non-pathogenic organism that can sustain high hydrostatic pressure. This protein will play a cohesive role in maintaining the structure of the chimeric protein, ensuring it maintains an acceptable level of stability and toughness for use in wet or humid environments such as the human body. It can possibly improve its adhesion for biomedical applications without any safety concerns. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  P. Pastoris will be used for protein expression and post-modification. Gluessel is planning to  incorporate a co-expression system that catalyzes the production of DOPA within the host cells. Normally, Unmodified MAPs contain the tyrosine residue that would be post-translationally modified to DOPA. In addition to expression of MAPs in the yeast cells, tyrosinase, enzyme responsible for conversion of tyrosine to DOPA, will also be expressed in P.Pastoris, for modifying the MAPs in vivo and eliminating the need for expensive post-modification processes, thus increasing efficiency and reducing time and cost. P. Pastoris is an ideal host for this approach due to its high growth rate, ease of genetic manipulation, and the ability to perform proper glycosylation of the target protein. It also overcomes the limitations associated with bacterial expression systems, such as intracellular aggregation, misfolding, and degradation of heterologous proteins by proteases.

                  Overall, this project provides a promising alternative to current MAP extraction methods, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution for producing MAP-based biomedical adhesives and coatings.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Microneedles offer a solution for diabetes patients seeking a minimally invasive and more effective alternative to conventional needles used in Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs). While traditional needles may cause minimal pain, microneedle arrays have the potential to revolutionize glucose sensing by improving the lifespan of glucose-sensing enzymes and enhancing the sensitivity of glucose sensors. The high surface area of microneedle arrays provides ample immobilization sites for enzymes, which increases enzyme loading capacity and stability, thereby protecting the immobilized enzyme and enhancing sensitivity to glucose fluctuation in Interstitial Fluid (ISF). Moreover, when combined with a machine learning model and algorithm, microneedle arrays can provide more precise and accurate glucose readings, further enhancing their effectiveness. The combination of microneedle arrays and machine learning has the potential to increase the integrability of CGMs with other diabetes management tools, closing the loop and offering a more comprehensive and effective personal health management solution.

                  The combination of MAPs and microneedles presents an exciting avenue for enhancing the stability and lifespan of biosensors. With its high concentration of DOPA residue, MAPs offer a unique opportunity to form an even film on the surface of electrodes through electrochemical oxidation in one step. 
                </p>

                <p class="card-text">
                  The process begins with the preparation of a MAP and GOx mixture in acetate buffer. The mixture is then subjected to electropolymerization on the working electrode of the microneedle sensor, utilizing potential cycling from -0.3-0.7 V against Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 100mVs-1. During this process, the oxidation of MAP molecules and their covalent bonding with GOx enzymes occur simultaneously in one step, resulting in the formation of an even layer on the microneedle's surface. The electrochemical oxidation method for coating microneedles with MAPs and GOx offers numerous benefits, including improved stability, extended lifespan, and enhanced sensitivity of glucose sensors. Our approach is a promising step forward in the development of more robust biosensors that can deliver accurate, reliable glucose readings for diabetes management.
