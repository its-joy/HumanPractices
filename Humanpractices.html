  <p style="color: white;">An important aspect of Gluessel was creating a continuous glucose monitor that catered to the needs of our end-users- diabetes patients. By learning more about the process and experience of using a CGM from a patient and clinician’s perspective, we were able to identify inadequacies in current technology and refocus our project to better address them.


    To help us better understand the general experience of Type 2 Diabetes patients who use CGM’s we spoke to Dave Djyur, a Dietitian and Education Consultant at Alberta Health Services (AHS). Given his extensive experience in the Clinical Management and Health Informatics, he helped us identify primary concerns that often make CGM’s difficult to use. During our meeting, Dave mentioned that besides the cost of the devices, most CGM sensors don’t adhere to a patient’s arm or abdomen for the entirety of the sensor’s life-span, forcing patients to reinsert a new device. We also learned that the length of the insertion needle was not a common concern amongst patients and that companies such as Libre had painless and easy insertion methods that didn’t cause discomfort.
    
    This was also vocalised in our interview with Bev Madrick, a Type 1 Diabetes patient and AHS Education Consultant who specialises in Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) Pumps and Type 1 Diabetes management. Since the needle is hidden in the insertion device, patients don’t often consider the length of the needle. Another aspect we hadn’t considered before was that a CGM device had to serve different purposes between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes patients. When using an AID Pump, leading CGM devices aren’t interoperable and can’t work in conjunction with them leaving patients to use “hack pumps”. In addition Bev’s key advice was to focus on the user-experience of our biosensor and app to create a more functional product. Through the algorithm and software, the Interstitial Fluid Glucose time lag could be eradicated ensuring real-time monitoring on an Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP). The app associated with the device could also allow patients to generate daily/weekly AGP reports to better keep their diabetes in check.
    
    Despite our initial goal of implementing microneedle technology into CGM’s, Bev and Dave’s feedback has helped us identify more prominent concerns related to the user-friendliness and longevity of the technology. Through our usage of the recombinantly produced MAP’s our solution needs to focus on extending the lifespan of Glucose-Oxidase and taking advantage of their adhesive properties to skin. An idea that was expressed in both interviews was that it was crucial for the team to try out different CGM’s on ourselves to better understand the experience of using them.
